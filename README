== ComMet: an HMM-based approach to detection of differentially methylated regions


==== Required libraries 

Boost C++ libraries 
http://www.boost.org/


==== Build

$ tar xzvf ComMet-xxx.tar.gz
$ cd ComMet-xxx
$ make

You will find the executable in src directory.


==== Usage

For help,
$ ComMet --help

For test run,
$ ComMet example/example.in example/example.out1 example/example.out2

For more output DMRs,
$ ComMet --threshold -5 example/example.in example/example.out1 example/example.out2

For more accurate DMRs, 
$ ComMet --dual example/example.in example/example.out1 example/example.out2

Combining them, 
$ ComMet --dual --threshold -5 example/example.in example/example.out1 example/example.out2


==== Input format

See example/example.in 

Col.| Description
----+--------------------------------------
1   | chromosome name 
2   | 0-based genomic position
3   | number of reads supporting mC in sample1
4   | number of reads not supporting mC in sample1
5   | number of reads supporting mC in sample2
6   | number of reads not supporting mC in sample2

reads supporting mC = C-C matches
reads not supporting mC = otherwise

Make sure chromosome names and genomic positions are sorted by "sort -k1,1 -k2,2n".

Note that input files do not contain strand information. 
Normally, you should integrate both strands by summing the read counts at two neighbor CpGs,
i.e. the 5'-CpG-3' in the plus strand, and the neighboring 3'-GpC-5' in the minus strand. 
Alternatively, if you are interested in strand-specific DMRs, you can prepare two input files 
for plus and minus strands, and apply them to ComMet separately. 


==== Output format

output1 contains information of differential methylation at individual cytosines.
See example/example.out1_

Col.| Description
----+--------------------------------------
1   | chromosome name 
2   | 0-based genomic position
3   | mC ratio in sample1
4   | mC ratio in sample2 
5   | prob. for hypermethylation (UP) in sample1 against sample2
6   | prob. for hypomethylation (DOWN) in sample1 against sample2
7   | prob. for no methylation change (NoCh) between sample1 and sample2

output2 contains information of detected DMRs. 
See example/example.out2_

Col.| Description
----+--------------------------------------
1   | chromosome name 
2   | 0-based genomic start position
3   | 0-based genomic stop position
4   | direction of differential methylation (UP/DOWN) comparing sample1 to sample2
5   | log-likelihood ratio score 


==== FAQ

Q. What is the meaning of the error "distance between neighbor CpGs must not be less than 2"?
A. 
Your input file contains invalid genomic positions. 
By definition of CpG, the base next to C must be G, and therefore two neighbor CpGs should be 
separated by at least two bases. Your input file may violate this rule for several reasons.  
First, the input file may contain two neighbor CpGs from different strands, 
i.e. the 5'-CpG-3' in the plus strand, and the neighboring 3'-GpC-5' in the minus strand. 
See the "Input format" section above for this issue. 
Second, the input file may contain cytosines in non-CpG context; just remove them. 

Q. Does ComMet support DMRs in non-CpG context (CHG or CHH)?
A. 
No. But we are planning to address this issue in the next version of ComMet.

Q. The read counts in the example input file are decimals rather than integers. Why?
A. 
Either decimals or integers can be used for read counts in input files. 
The reason that the example input file contains decimals is that some alignment tools produce 
probability-weighted read counts. Of course, you can use your favorite aligners for preparing 
input files that may contain integers only.


==== History

* version 1.0
- tuned the default parameters
- added the FAQ in README

* version 0.1 
- implemented the algorithms described in [Saito et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 2013]


==== Bisulfighter

ComMet was first developed as the DMR detection module in Bisulfighter, 
a software package for mC calling and DMR detection. 
Compatibility between ComMet and the mC calling module in Bisulfighter is 
kept by input-output transformation scripts in util directory.
